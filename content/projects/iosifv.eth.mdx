## My Ethereum Journey

#### 2016

I heard about Ethereum and decided to buy a cloud mining account for 500$. I think it was a service that was offering around 20 MH/s

#### 2017

After my cloud-mining account finished I gathered around 90 ETH which I sold for around 700$. I was happy with making a 200$ profit from my initial investment.
I soon realised that I made a mistake and bought back about 10 ETH for around 100$.
Not long after I started looking into mining and bought a mining rig with 6 GPUs.
Crazy times, I remember I had that mining rig running for a year and a half in my room. The sound and heat were unbearable, basically I was sleepoing with noise cancelling headphones and an open window even during the winter.

#### 2018

Around this time I decided to take things seriously. Created a company with my family and started investing in a crypto mining farm.
Initial investment was around 45k EUR and we bought 72 GPUs.
We encountered so many weird issues, from not having enough power to run all the GPUs, to figuring out the actual location of where to keep the rigs in our house.
I was working continuously on improving my skills and knowledge in this field to be able to squeeze out another 1% in mining profits.

#### 2022

I decided to learn Solidity and started building a simple smart contracts. I used a tutorial by Patrick Collins on Freecodecamp and decided to document the process on a git page https://iosifv.github.io/learning/.
In that endeavour I created my custom ENS domain at https://iosifv.eth.limo/.
In september 2022 when Ethereum switched to proof of stake I decided to switch off my crypto mining farm.

## ENS Domain

How an Ethereum (ETH) Domain Works
An ETH domain is a decentralized domain name based on the Ethereum Name Service (ENS).
ENS is a system built on the Ethereum blockchain that maps human-readable names like iosifv.eth to blockchain addresses, websites, and other types of information. It eliminates the need to use long, complex Ethereum wallet addresses.
So, in other words, if you want to send me some ETH you can just type iosifv.eth in your destination wallet address field and send it to me :)
