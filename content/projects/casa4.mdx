What do you do when you're on a holiday in Cyprus? Swim in the sea? Relax by the pool? Well, if you're me, you obviously go to a rave festival ([BEON1X](https://beonix.art/)) but you also decide it's the perfect time to build your freelance website! Here's how it all went down:

#### Terraform, 10 km in the air

Most people watch movies or sleep on planes. Me? I decided it was the perfect time to learn Terraform. Yep, while flying to Cyprus, I was busy figuring out how to manage infrastructure as code, because why not?

#### Coding in a Coffee Shop

After landing, I had a few hours to kill before meeting my friend. Naturally, I found a coffee shop, opened my laptop, and got to work. There’s something about coding in a new country that makes you feel like a digital nomad, even if it's just in an airport café.

#### The Result?

A shiny new website for my freelancing work, built with

- Terraform - Infrastructure as Code
- Hugo - Static Site Generator
- Cloudflare - for the DNS
- Github Actions - for the CI/CD

And yes, I managed to pick up Terraform along the way (still not sure how my brain did that on a plane ride). Moral of the story? You can mix work and play if you're a nerd like me.

A minimal website for my freelancing work.

The story behind this is pretty funny:

I needed a new website just to have a nice field to add on my invoices, so I decided to make one.

Now what's the point of just making something without actually learning something new in the process.
Bonus points if there's
Cue in a 3h plane flight during the night and then a few hours wait until my friend would arrive to the holiday destination:

I'm not a designer, but I did my best to make it look good.

I need you to help me make a blog post to cover the following story that I will summarise in bullet points:

- I built this website for my freelancing work
- I built this website during a holliday in Cyprus
- I wanted to learn some new technologies and tools within the process
- I learned Terraform on the plane ride before getting to Cyprus
- did some extra work in the coffee shop in the airport while waiting for my friend to arrive
- I have 2 pictures, one with the plane ride and one with the coffee shop
