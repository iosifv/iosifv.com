### The Accidental Project

#### From T3 Stack Training to a Real Tool

This whole thing started as a simple **[T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/)** training project. At least, that was the plan. But, like any good coding adventure, things quickly spiraled.

While I was working on it, I thought, “Why not make this production-ready? And hey, let’s make it free for everyone while we’re at it!” It all began when I tried to calculate my recurring monthly expenses. I figured there had to be a tool out there for this, right? Wrong. After searching around and finding nothing that fit my needs, I did what any self-respecting financially savvy person would do: I made a complex spreadsheet.

Naturally, the next logical step was to turn that spreadsheet into an actual app. Because when in doubt, always make things harder for yourself, right?

Here’s the plan:

- **What goes in:** a bunch of text based expenses
- **A few pie charts:** so that hopefully you can say stuff like “Oh wow! I spend $100 monthly on _XYZ Category_, let's cut this down”

Here’s what I needed (and consequently, what I am building):

- **Simple UI** (because who has time for overly complicated dashboards?)
- **No linking bank accounts** (because I don’t want to be tracked by anyone)
- **No extra fluff** (I’m talking to you, unnecessary features)
- **Free to use** (because expenses are enough trouble without paying for the calculator)
- **Organise stuff in Categories** (because life is supposed to be organised)
- **Multi-currency support** (because why should my pounds and euros be kept apart?)
- **Crypto-currency support** (because I’m a crypto-nerd)

And that’s how this little training project snowballed into a full-blown, tool set to become a production-ready tool.
