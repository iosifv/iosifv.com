#### A Huge Man in a Tiny Van: My Vanlife Adventure

I’m a pretty big guy, yet for some reason, I have a thing for small spaces. Blame it on the vanlife trend — I got hooked. For years, I imagined having my own van, one I’d build myself. And sure, the idea of traveling was cool, but let's be honest: I was probably dreaming more about _coding in strange places_ than exploring new countries or to actually live full time in a van.

#### The Big Yellow Submarine

Fast forward to 2023, when I made the leap and bought my very own big, bright yellow van. It's the kind of van that people either assume is full of snacks or questionably large boxes. Little did they know, I was about to transform it into a full-on home on wheels.

I spent almost a year working on it getting delayed mostly by my lack of knowledge, lack of planing, time to actually work and most importantly the lack of a propper workshop.
Regardless, I ended up turning this submarine into a cozy little space where I can sleep, cook, and yes, code in weird places — because what’s the point of vanlife without a bit of Wi-Fi?

#### The Build Journey

The process was an adventure in itself. I tackled everything from installing solar panels to building cabinets that sort of open without falling apart. I documented the whole journey on Instagram, so you can check out my misadventures and occasional successes right here: [@homeless.developer](https://www.instagram.com/homeless.developer/)

#### What’s Next?

Now that the van’s ready to roll, I’m set to hit the road — laptop in hand — probably finding the most scenic spots to work on code that’ll make people say, “Wait, you did that from where?”
